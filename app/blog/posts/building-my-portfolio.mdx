I recently rebuilt my portfolio website using modern web technologies. In this post, I'll walk you through the tech stack, architecture decisions, and key features.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 13**: For server-side rendering and routing with App Router
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility-first approach
- **MDX**: For blog posts with React components
- **React Icons**: For beautiful icons and social media integration
- **Sugar High**: For syntax highlighting in code blocks
- **Gray Matter**: For MDX frontmatter parsing
- **Next Sitemap**: For SEO optimization
- **PWA Support**: For installable web app experience

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Blog with MDX and Syntax Highlighting

I implemented a blog system using MDX with Sugar High for beautiful code highlighting:

```typescript filename="lib/blog.ts"
// lib/blog.ts
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

export function getPostBySlug(slug: string) {
  const fullPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'app/blog/posts', `${slug}.mdx`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents)
  
  return {
    slug,
    content,
    ...data
  }
}
```

### 2. Responsive Navigation

The navigation system adapts to different screen sizes:

```typescript filename="components/Navigation.tsx"
// components/Navigation.tsx
export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav className="fixed top-0 w-full bg-zinc-900/80 backdrop-blur-md z-50">
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 h-16 flex items-center justify-between">
        <Logo />
        <DesktopNav />
        <MobileNav />
      </div>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

### 3. Dark Mode Design

I chose a dark theme for better readability and modern aesthetics:

```typescript filename="tailwind.config.js"
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        zinc: {
          850: '#1f1f1f',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### 4. Search Functionality

Implemented a search system that works across pages and blog posts:

```typescript filename="api/search/route.ts"
// api/search/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const query = searchParams.get('q')

  // Search implementation
  const results = await searchContent(query)
  return NextResponse.json(results)
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**:
```typescript filename="components/MDXContent.tsx"
<Image
  src={post.coverImage}
  alt={post.title}
  width={1200}
  height={630}
  className="rounded-xl"
  priority
/>
```

2. **Code Splitting**:
```typescript filename="components/MDXContent.tsx"
const MDXContent = dynamic(() => import('@/components/MDXContent'), {
  loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>
})
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Vercel, which provides:
- Automatic deployments
- Edge functions
- Analytics
- Great performance out of the box

## Lessons Learned

1. **TypeScript is Worth It**: While it requires more initial setup, TypeScript caught many bugs before they reached production.

2. **MDX for Content**: Using MDX for blog posts provides great flexibility in mixing markdown with React components.

3. **Tailwind's Utility-First Approach**: Tailwind CSS made styling consistent and maintainable across the project.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication for a comment system
- Implement a newsletter
- Add more interactive components
- Improve search with better algorithms

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio was a great learning experience. The combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS proved to be powerful and developer-friendly.
